	<p>I love talking about and working with stacks and queues not only because they are intuitive - but because of the insane advantage I have over my American counterparts, as someone who grew up in Europe, in spelling the word queue. One of my favorite things is watching my peers struggle to spell this word and the different techniques that these brilliant software engineers come up to spell this word that I had mastered by the age of five.</p>
