	<h2> Stacks and Queues </h2>
	<p>I love talking about and working with stacks and queues not only because they are intuitive - but because of the insane advantage I have over my American counterparts, as someone who grew up in Europe, in spelling the word queue. One of my favorite things is watching my peers struggle to spell this word and the different techniques that these brilliant software engineers come up to spell this word that I had mastered by the age of five.</p>

	<h2> All About Stacks </h2>
	<p>Stacks are data structures that operate using <b>LIFO</b> (last in first out) ordering. Meaning when you pop (remove) an item from a stack - you will receive the most recently pushed item. I like to think of this like a stack of papers, if you pile papers on top of each other and then go to retrieve one, you'll receive the most recently added paper (the paper on top of the stack).</p>
	<p>Some notes on time complexity: adding and removing takes place in constant time. However, unlike arrays accessing elements at specific indices does not take place in constant time.</p>
	<h2>All About Queues</h2>
	<p>Queues are data structures that operate using <b>FIFO</b> (first in first out) ordering. So, you remove items in the orderer they were added in. The best way to think of this is just like a line at the bank. Usually, people are removed from the line in the order they arrived (except for that one time that lady cut me while I was tying my shoes, but the story of why I always wear flip flops to the bank is a story for another day).</p>
